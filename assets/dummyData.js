		question: "What does the color of period blood mean?",
		replies: [
			"According to the American Academy of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, your period blood's colour and consistency reflect one's overall health. However, since everyone's period varies is different and colour changes from month to month, it becomes very important to be aware of colour which is “normal” and “healthy” and colour which requires clinical attention. Normal and healthy” colour of period blood keeps changing from brown/black to bright red to pink depending upon how long the blood remained in the uterus.",
			"\nPink: This colour indicated the beginning of your periods when the freshly released bright red colour mixes with vaginal discharge and turns pink. Pink colour may also indicate lighter periods.\nBright Red: As you will see period paces up, bright red colour which is fresh and new and has just passed from vagina will be seen. Yet again when you have period cramps, and the heavy flow, the bright red will linger on.\n Dark Red: When the blood remains longer in the vagina, the colour is usually dark red and may be accompanied with some clots. However, if the clots are bigger than quarter consult a doctor immediately.\nBlack or Brown : The blood which has remained longer in the vagina and exit late is often black or brown colour. The dark brown or dark red colour makes the blood appear black. And the dark blood when mixes with vaginal discharge often makes it look brown which is often towards the end of your periods.\nYour period blood changes as the day advances. However, all the colour changes doesn't mean normal, there are certain times when you require medical attention.\nBright Red Blood:Bright red blood before the start of period requires attention as it may indicate infection like Chlamydia and gonorrhoea\n Bleeding is sometimes normal in pregnancy but in case you see bright red blood with heavy flow might indicate miscarriage.\n Sometimes Polyps or fibroids which is a noncancerous growth in the uterus may cause heavy flow with bright red colour blood along with pain and pressure\n Pink Blood: Sometimes and not always pink blood might indicate low estrogens' levels\n Grey Blood: Grey colour is something you need immediate medical attention especially if you have pain, fever, itching, and foul odour because this indicates infection like bacterial vaginosis or commonly called BV.",

		question: "How to know why baby is crying?",
		replies: [
			"Listen for a low-pitched, rhythmic, repetitive cry, combined with other signals such as rooting for the breast, a sucking motion with her tongue, lip-smacking, or putting her fingers into her mouth. Respond to hunger cues quickly so that baby doesn't get too worked up. If she's upset and begins gulping air with her milk, she may trap gas or spit up, which will probably result in more crying.",
			"Soft whimpers that are weak and nasal-sounding, with a lower pitch than the pain or overtired cry — as if baby doesn't have the energy to pump up the volume. If you suspect your baby is sick, be on the lookout for additional symptoms that warrant a call to the doctor, such as fever, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, rashes and anything else that seems out-of-the-ordinary for your baby. There's no sadder cry that tugs harder at parental heartstrings than this one.",

			"No. I wish you could talk to someone at your school to understand what happens during birth.",
			"When your body is ready to deliver, contractions start. That means, all of the muscles in your midsection contract painfully and get hard as a rock. This is your body getting ready to push the baby out. There are breathing exercises you can do during these contractions to make them a little more tolerable. You had better start practicing, because it is a learning process.",
			"I hope you know about the cervix, that tiny opening through which your period blood comes out every month? Well, that is where the baby comes out. Normally, it is closed up pretty tightly. During labor, that will start to open up. When it is 10 cm opened, that is when you deliver.",
			"Now, 10 cm is not a lot. The plates in the baby's head are very flexible, and they get squeezed together in order to pass through. Trust me, when the time comes you will not even feel your vagina stretching. It will snap back to normal afterwards, so kind of forget about stretching it out.",

			"What are the common first signs of pregnancy? How can I tell if I'm pregnant? What are the symptoms?",
		replies: [
			"I have been pregnant 5 times and have 4 beautiful babies to kiss every day (with one angel baby). Our first was conceived after 11 months of trying, and the rest were planned and pretty easily conceived. I knew I was pregnant well before my period was due each time.\nEvery woman is different, as is each pregnancy. You may have absolutely no signs of pregnancy and still be pregnant. So do not give up hope on this cycle if you are not experiencing any of the following early pregnancy symptoms. Even if you are experiencing every single symptom listed, there is no guarantee you are pregnant. Trust me, I imagined them all – month after month – while trying for our first baby. So take them all with a grain of salt, but also tune in to your body.\nIf you are seeing or feeling any of these signs, wait a few days before you test because a negative test is crappy to see! (Although those $1 tests are worth investing in – or the box of 50 on amazon!)",
			"Early signs:\nFeeling 'Off' – Sometimes you can't put a pin on it, but you just feel different; not really sick or unhappy, cranky, or blah – just 'off.' Your body may trying to tell you something!\nBasal Body Temperature – If you are charting your cycles and following your basal body temperature (This is your internal temperature to the nearest hundredth instead of tenth), you will notice an upward shift. A BBT spike above baseline for an extended period of time (3-4 days) after ovulation means pregnancy. You may even see a triphasic chart, which means your BBT will do a third shift and increase again",
			"The HCG hormone that is released in early pregnancy is rising fast. It may trigger many more symptoms before you take a pregnancy test, such as:\nNausea\nFrequent urination\nShortness of breath\nSore breasts\nConstipation\nHeadaches\nBack pain\nDizziness and fainting\nMood swings\nFood aversions\nBloating\nNipple darkening\nCravings\nRunny nose, cold and flu symptom",

		question: "Can one terminate a month-long pregnancy?",
		replies: [
			"1 month? Most women haven't even realized they're pregnant after one month. It is absolutely not too late to terminate this pregnancy if that is what you choose to do. Pretty much all clinics in the US will perform abortions during the entirety of the first trimester-- 12 weeks. Lots of clinics will perform the abortion up to the 24th week. Beyond the 24th week, the fetus has a chance to survive outside of the womb and doctors in most states will only perform the late term abortion if your life is in danger.",
			"Go to www.plannedparenthood.org. You can get their phone number there and call them to get more information about abortion and other options, too. They will help you find a clinic in your area and knowledgeably answer any questions you might have with total respect and understanding. I'm not sure how old you are, but if you live in a state where you need parental consent, there is a possibility that it can be waived by a judge if you believe that you will be in any kind of danger from informing your parents of your pregnancy. Be sure to ask planned parenthood about that if you need help with that, too.",
			"Never NEVER attempt to perform the abortion on your own. If you are worried about the cost, talk to planned parenthood or the clinic about it. They may be able to waive part or all of the fee or establish a payment plan for you. Please DO NOT put yourself in danger like that. I saw an earlier answer from someone who is anti-choice that stated you can perform an abortion yourself anytime with the right tools. This person has no idea who you are and is not concerned whatsoever with your safety. PLEASE allow a medical professional to handle this procedure. In a lot of states, an abortion pill is available that does not even require surgery. DO NOT ever attempt to preform an abortion without a medical professional.",

		question:
			"What do I do if I'm constantly getting infections down there. I have discharge everyday and have to use pantyliners all the time. How can I stop this?",
		replies: [
			"FIRST you need to see your doctor or a women's health clinic to find out what SORT of infection you are having. You may need treatment with a prescription drug to get rid of the discharge. It may be bacteria, it may be fungus, or it may be an STD. There are other medical conditions that can make run-of-the-mill infections more common, like diabetes, and they can tell you if you should be checked for these things.",
			"Common causes of recurring bacterial or 'yeast' infections are:\n1. Synthetic underwear, which not ONLY hold moisture, but can also be hard to sterilize, Cotton underwear breathes, and the dryer or drying on the line in the sun will sterilize them.\n2. Improper use of toilet paper! Crazy, I know, but lots of women do not know they should always wipe by reaching through from behind without touching the paper to their body, and THEN wiping backward ONLY. If you wipe forward you move bacteria from feces into your vaginal area, and can cause infection.\n3. Doucheing, and unsanitized douche equipment. Douche equipment needs to be sterilized between uses, and excess douching can upset the pH of your vagina and make it easier for bacteria to infect you, AND prevent your body from delivering the immune cells you need to fight infection.\n4. A partner who is infected but not bothered by whatever you are infected with. This is true of some STD's, but also true of some bacterial infections.\n5. A partner with poor personal (or dental) hygeine.\n6. Failing to wash your own hands or toys before you touch your genitals with them.",
			" YOUR personal hygeine, especially during your period. Change pads or tampons about every 4 hours, and no MORE than 8hrs (they should not have a bad odor when they are removed), and wash externally with soap and water at least daily.",

		question: "Can You Heal Menstrual Cramps With Home Remedies?",
		replies: [
			"Try Some Yoga Poses to Ease Menstrual Pain\nWhether it's the stretching of your muscles or the relaxing effect of the poses, a regular yoga practice can indeed help your cramps.\nWhen 20 undergraduate students did an hour-long yoga program once a week for three months, they had less menstrual cramping and period distress than 20 women who didn't, according to researchers for a study published in September 2016 in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine.\nThe Journal of Physiotherapy review that sanctioned heating pads also found benefits for yoga.\nYou can practice during your period or between them, but some instructors advise women against doing inverted poses (like a shoulder stand) in the midst of menstruation, so as not interfere with your natural flow.",
			"Curl Up With a Heating Pad to Ease Period Cramps\n“The uterus is a muscle, so anything that helps relax muscles, like applying heat, can be beneficial, Thielen says.\nIndeed, research published in Evidence-Based Nursing found that topically applied heat was just as effective as ibuprofen for period cramps. Over the two study days, the women used heat alone, heat plus ibuprofen, ibuprofen alone, or a placebo. The best results were in the heat plus ibuprofen group; adding heat led to faster improvements.",
			"Pop a Safe Painkiller to Cut the Inflammation\nModerate use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) medication like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or  naproxen (Aleve) is one of the best ways to curb period pain, Thielen says. This is because NSAIDs reduce the amount of prostaglandins in the body. For this reason, taking a pill just before you get your period can keep the level of pain-causing prostaglandins from rising, she says.\n As with any medicine, you should first check with your doctor to be sure NSAIDs are a good choice for you, especially if you have a history of bleeding or stomach or kidney issues.\nIf the NSAIDs you buy in the store don't offer enough relief, your doctor might prescribe an NSAID with more potency. “Some women need up to 800 milligrams three times a day for cramps. You'd have to take a lot of over-the-counter pills to equal that,” Thielen says",
